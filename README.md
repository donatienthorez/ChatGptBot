# ChatGptBot

This repository contains the source code for a chat application that uses the OpenAI API (and openai-kotlin library available [here](https://github.com/aallam/openai-kotlin)).
The app allows users to chat with an AI model that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate responses using the Chat Mode in OpenAI Playground.

# Libraries used
- Koin for dependency injection
- Jetpack Compose and Material3 for UI design

# Demo

# How to make it work
- Simply replace `OPEN_AI_API_KEY` in `app/gradle.properties` with your OpenAI API key that you can find [on OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
- NEVER publish that file to Github. I did it to show you how it works and have a quick setup. 

Enjoy!
